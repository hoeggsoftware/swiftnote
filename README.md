##CopyRight

- This theme is based on [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) 
- Code highlighter used [hilight.js](highlightjs.org) and [Solarized Light](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
- Search function used [jQueryHunter](https://github.com/jamalneufeld/ghostHunter), yeah, it's only support English, if you use other languages, you can replace lunr section with [lunr-languages](https://github.com/MihaiValentin/lunr-languages) (but excerpt Chinese)
